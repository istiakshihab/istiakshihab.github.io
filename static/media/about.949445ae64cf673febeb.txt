  I'm a full-time Backend Software Engineer at bKash Ltd where I work with <u>Spring Boot</u> and <u>Reactive Java</u>. I have
  graduated from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology with an engineering degree in Computer Science and
  Engineering. Although, I never meant to walk this way during my childhood, I am loving the journey I am having right
  now. Currently, I'm exploring <u>Deep Learning</u> when I'm not busy with my office work. My research interests include:

  <div class="container" style="padding-left: 4vh; ">
    <ul>
      <li>Computer Vision</li>
      <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  If you want to work or discuss with
  me regarding this topic, I would love to collaborate with you. I also have professional experience with
  <u>Android Application Development</u> and <u>Django</u>. Other than that, I play video games (namely Dota 2 and Valorant) and won't
  like to game with you, probably. I'm somewhat of a music snob too and currently obsessing over Neutral Milk Hotel and
  Reo Speedwagon. My love for the new Retro aesthetics and the movie "Drive" inspired me to build this website. Also,
  Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably my most favorite anime. Thanks for reading!
